# Dungeons and Monsters
Mar 2022 - Apr 2022

Create a Java program that allows a user to explore a dungeon maze and fight monsters that they encounter along the way. 
The user is a hero of the game and the mission is to explore the mazes and defeat monsters to level up, essentially similar to Pokemon but in a Hero and Monsters interface.
A hero has 3 different attack classes: Physical, Magic and Range. Each attack class also has different subclasses. 
There are a total of 3 different maps and throughout the maps there are monster dungeons and  stores, where heroes can buy potions or keys to unlock a new level  .
